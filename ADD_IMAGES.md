## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Image not showing?
1. **Check filename** - Must be exact (case-sensitive on some systems)
2. **Check location** - Must be in `public/images/hero/` or `public/images/gallery/`
3. **Hard refresh** - Press Ctrl + Shift + R in browser
4. **Check file format** - Must be `.jpg` (not .jpeg, .png, etc.)

### Image looks stretched or weird?
- **Check dimensions** - Should be 1920x1080 for hero, 1200x900 for gallery
- **Check aspect ratio** - Maintain proper proportions

### Image loads slowly?
- **File too large** - Compress at https://tinypng.com
- **Target**: Under 500KB for hero, under 300KB for gallery
